## Description

LogoPicture AI is an innovative project that uses artificial intelligence to generate unique and creative pictures with your logo "hidden" in them. Optical illusions with your logo as I like to say.

## Features

- AI-powered pictures generation
- User-friendly interface
- Customizable picture design parameters

## Installation

To install LogoPicture AI, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garrrikkotua/logopictureai.git
cd logopictureai
npm install
npm run dev
```

You also need to provide several env variables - take a look at `.env.example`.

LogoPicture AI uses Supabase, Replicate and Resend.

Then, go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.
